**Title**:  About the Extremal Principle: From Convex Analysis to Nonsmooth Analysis (Geometric Considerations)

**Abstract**: In this talk, I will formulate a number of optimality conditions appearing in non-smooth optimisation and approximation problems. Most of these conditions can be formulated in terms of convex polytopes. This geometrical interpretation of optimality gives rise to beautiful mathematical theories as well as computational methods. Most example of this talk are coming from polynomial and piecewise polynomial approximation (classical results) and approximation by neural networks (current research). 
 
**Speaker**: A/Prof. Nadezda Sukhorukova, Department of Mathematics, Swinburne University of Technology.

**Bio**:   PhD, Applied Mathematics Federation University Australia (former University of Ballarat), Australia PhD, Applied Mathematics and Optimisation St-Petersburg State University, Russian Federation.
Currently, I am at Swinburne University of Technology, School of Science, Computing and Emerging Technologies, Department of Mathematics.

My research interests are in the area of Mathematical Optimisation an applications to real-life problems. One of the recent applications is approximation, data analysis and deep learning. I approach them from the point of view of modern optimisation.
